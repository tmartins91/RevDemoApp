# RevDemoApp

This repository holds the source code of the RevDemoApp Application, a simple real-time currency converter Android application where users can convert the desired amount to other currencies based on the current currency rate. This application was created by Tiago Martins, as part of the technical assessment required by a UK company during their recruitment process.

This application was developed based on MVP architecture, with Dagger2, RxJava, and Retrofit.
